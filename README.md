## Features
- ### Responsive Layout: The template is designed to be visually appealing and functional across various devices and screen sizes.
- ### Real-Time Color Coding: The app dynamically color-codes each time block to visually indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future based on the current time. This helps users quickly identify their current schedule status.
- ### Event Input and Storage: Users can click into any time block, enter an event or task in the associated textarea, and save it using the corresponding save button. The entered events are then stored in the browser's local storage, allowing the information to persist even after refreshing the page.
